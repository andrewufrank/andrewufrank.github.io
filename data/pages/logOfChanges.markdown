The list of changes one might apply to personalize the model:

Adapt the theme in the 'theme' folder:

1. Add name and byline to the 'settings.yml' file.
2. Add a picture of high quality, possibly cropped to an aspect ratio of 1:4, as jpg file into 
'static/img/' and change the name of the image in the 'static/styles' file. 

Adapt content in the 'data/pages' folder:

1. Rewrite the 'welcome.markdown' file. You may remove or change the link to this 'logOfChanges'.
2. Rewrite the 'minimalCV.markdown' file and include a longer CV in the linked 'longCV.markdown' file.
3. Rewrite the 'contacts.markdown'.

These are the easy changes, editing a bunch of files, using markdown. Some instructions on markdown are found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

For the blog, one can just add a markdown text in a file in 'posts' as 'postOne.markdown';
the blog title is then automatically included in the list of blogs shown under the menu item "Blog" with its title; a click leads then to the blog contant. 

In the blog post "How to add a publication list" under Blog (or [here](posts/constructingPubList) ) I explainhow to construct a publication list from a BibTex file.
