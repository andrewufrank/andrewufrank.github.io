# Not My Homepage --- under construction

This is the start of a homepage to communicate to other what is important
to me as a researcher. It could show:

- chronological list of publications, as complete as possible and with links for download
- list of publications ordered by research topics
- drafts of papers for discussion
- my blog with smaller ideas and observations 
- Curriculum vitae of various levels of detail
- my contact addresses

To make things easier for adaption, the bottom of the page says which source file is used and which template was applied. More details of the changes applied are described [here](logOfChanges).
