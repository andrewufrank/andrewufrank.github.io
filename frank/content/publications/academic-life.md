<h2>Colleagues and friends</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have had the pleasure to work with a number of colleagues and friends during my academic career; I appreciate their contributions to my work and the acknowledge here their influence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my understanding, science is not only following the motto "We stand on the shoulders of giants", pointing to the use of results of previous generations of researchers which we (mostly) duly cite  but also a social endeavor benefiting from the interaction of researchers as colleagues in their offices, during conferences and visits. This account tries to recover and document the many influental contacts I had. </p>

<h2>Highschool (Gymnasium) and Undergraduate Studies in Zurich</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During my school years in Zürich I had twice outstanding math teachers: Stiefel and Senft, who lied the foundation to my understanding of mathematics. </p>

<p>At ETH Zürich, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urs_Stammbach">Urs Stammbach</a> (with a script co-authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Huber">Peter Huber</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henrici_(mathematician)">Peter Henrici</a>) lectured during a year for two hours three times a week on analysis. The influence of a true "engineer" <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Schneider_(Bauingenieur)">Jörg Schneider</a> instilled in my a method to identify practical problems and to investigate gradual approaches to improvement; his interest in security and risk in building design   guided   my work on data quality decades later. I was fortunate to hear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellmut_Schmid">HH Schmid</a> on his statistically enlightened view on photogrammetry <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">1</a></sup>. The computer-science course was taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a> who stressed the theoretical foundations underpinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>, as I came to understand years later.</p>

<h2>Graduate studies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was asked by <a href="">Rudolf Conzett</a> to join his group as a research assistant   and was to start on January 1978 to explore the application of <a href="">Database Management Systems (DBMS)</a> to survyeing and real estate property registration. I was given an introductory text on database <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">3</a></sup> to read and explain to him and the rest of the team the database concepts. Later in the year I traveled with Conzett  to the workshop on <a href="">Land Information Systems</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, the first conference on a spatial information system to support town and country administration built on cadastral data collections in continental Europe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> I had to learn  <a href="">Cobol</a> to write programs for a network <a href="">CODASYL</a> database and create schema to store the data collected in the cadastral data collection in the canton "Basel Stadt". With Misslin I worked on an interactive tool to assess the quality of surveying measurements (standard deviation and not detectable gross errors); the approach distributed the "number crunching" on a mainframe (DEC-10) and the graphics as a front-end on a HP desktop computer <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> connected by an asynchronous V24 connection - adventurous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Egenhofer , who spent a semester away from the TU Stuttgart at ETH to work on his diploma thesis, we constructed a precompiler for an object-oriented Pascal dialect <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">5</a></sup>, which he then used for his diploma thesis on spatial query languages. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My second advisor, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_August_Zehnder">C.A. Zehnder</a> had me attend lectures on abstract data types by Engeli [] and another student from his group attended the workshop xxx and I was reading the proceedings and felt sorry that I had not attended the conference - only years later I met many of the participants. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I attended lectures by Nievergelt on User Interface Desgin [] and studied his work [fagin &amp; nievergelt]. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote a draft for a very theoretical thesis with a extremely formal and abstract treatment of spatial data , probably influenced by Lockemann and Mayer's book xxx and Kent's xxx discussion of semantics. Conzett found the approach too remote from practical problems and too philosophical (in tractatus style). My second start to write a thesis with the title ... was successful and I defended it a day before christmas 1982. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From my thesis work resulted several contriutions to conferences, three of them lead to a three week trip to the usa in summer 1982. my first trip to the USA: SIGgraph in Boston, SIGsmall in Colorado Springs and LIS ?? in Maine Orono. I visited also Schlumberger in ... to explore opportunities to work in spatial databases and user interface for oilwell exploration, but was offered an assistant professor position at the University of Maine in their survying engineering program - which I accepted to start Jan 1983. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Fall 1982 I presented at VLDB my approach to storage methods for fast access to spatially referenced data - an alternative to the R+ tree. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My research for the Ph.D. (exactly a Doctorate in technical science of ETH) on spatial inforamtion systems wasamong the few comprehensive and not application oriented treatment of what later became Geographic Inforamtion Systems. My work resulted in several reports which were (with others) the beginning of major research chains:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>data storage and access for spatial data (samet)</li><li>extending database query languages to retrieve data based on spatial attributes (ISO standad ..)</li><li>representation of geometry in computers </li><li>treatment of semantical and topological relations (what became (computer science) ontology). </li></ul>
