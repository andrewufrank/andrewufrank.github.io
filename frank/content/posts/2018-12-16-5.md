<h1>First Test Blog - Typed Filenames in HaskellThe package</h1>
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path">Path</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org">Hackage</a>&nbsp;gives a typed interface to handle file names and pathes; it differentiates between absolute and relative path and between directory and file. The differentiation seems useful and helps to prevent errors in handling files; it is a huge step to more secure programs compared to the previous simple type synonym "FilePath" (which stands for String) and its handlling.

Constructing a class to handle "old" (Filepath) and "new" (Path) typed filenames and path expressions should include an operation to add a filename to a path. Both libraries have corresponding operations:

<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath-1.4.1.2/docs/System-FilePath-Posix.html">FilePath&nbsp;</a>has:
(&lt;/&gt;) :: FilePath -&gt; FilePath -&gt; FilePath
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path-0.5.13/docs/Path.html">Path</a> has:
(&lt;/&gt;) :: Path b Dir -&gt; Path Rel t -&gt; Path b t

Define a class with, for now, a single operation to add a filename to a path which can be instantiated for path expressions of type FilePath and Path a b. The class may have more than one type parameter, but the result type must not be one of them. Type parameters in classes which are the result types require type annotations in most uses.

Hint: consider type families when searching for a solution.

Can the class be extended to include the other most important operations on filepath?
