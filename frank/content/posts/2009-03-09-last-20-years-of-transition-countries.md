A paragraph from "Die Zeit":<br /><br />The head of St. Petersburg TV mentioned that TV news during the Breshniew times were horrible: only official bulletins were read, but in the evening one could go for a stroll in the park without fear. In the 1990's anything could be said on TV, but in the evening you did not go for a walk for fear to be kidnapped  (5th march 2009, p. 47 - my rough translation).<br /><br />What does progress and democracy mean? For whom?
